The brat2json converter needs the following 4 directories:

<ol>
<li>txt -> Stores ACS txt files on which the NER annotations are made</li>
<li>ann -> Stores NER annotations (ann files) in BRAT format</li>
<li>json -> Stores JSON formatted ACS data</li>
<li>json_out -> Output directory for storing JSON formatted ACS data with NER annotations</li>
</ol>

A few sample files are provided in each directory.



**Note that it is assumed that the text in the txt files is the exact same as the text in ACS json files.**

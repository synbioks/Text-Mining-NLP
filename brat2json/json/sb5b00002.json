        "Many Gram-negative pathogens encode type 3 secretion systems, sophisticated nanomachines that deliver proteins directly into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. These systems present attractive opportunities for therapeutic protein delivery applications; however, their utility has been limited by their inherent pathogenicity. Here, we report the reengineering of a laboratory strain of with a tunable type 3 secretion system that can efficiently deliver heterologous proteins into mammalian cells, thereby circumventing the need for virulence attenuation. We first introduced a 31 kB region of DNA that encodes all of the information needed to form the secretion nanomachine onto a plasmid that can be directly propagated within or integrated into the chromosome. To provide flexible control over type 3 secretion and protein delivery, we generated plasmids expressing master regulators of the type 3 system from either constitutive or inducible promoters. We then constructed a Gateway-compatible plasmid library of type 3 secretion sequences to enable rapid screening and identification of sequences that do not perturb function when fused to heterologous protein substrates and optimized their delivery into mammalian cells. Combining these elements, we found that coordinated expression of the type 3 secretion system and modified target protein substrates produces a nonpathogenic strain that expresses, secretes, and delivers heterologous proteins into mammalian cells. This reengineered system thus provides a highly flexible protein delivery platform with potential for future therapeutic applications."

A therapeutic strategy that is gaining increasing interest is to engineer bacterial protein secretion systems to directly deliver bioactive payloads into mammalian cells.

Over the course of an infection, pathogens use these secretion systems to inject tens of proteins, referred to as effectors, into mammalian cells. The effectors target and regulate mammalian host cell processes to promote bacterial survival and replication. Extensive studies have established that type 3 effectors are designated as secreted substrates by sequences confined to their N-terminal 50\u2013100 amino acids. When fused to heterologous proteins of either of prokaryotic or eukaryotic origin, these sequences are sufficient to generate variants that are recognized and secreted by the T3SS machinery.",

Theoretically, a pathogenic strain could be generated that no longer expresses any virulence proteins, but this is not a practical strategy, as most pathogens encode multiple virulence determinants, some of which are likely not currently known. For these reasons, we sought to develop a system in which type 3 secretion system functions could be introduced into a nonpathogenic, easily culturable laboratory strain. Here, we describe the generation of nonpathogenic strains of that encode a functional T3SS from a pathogen,, and show that these strains are fully capable of delivering heterologous proteins into mammalian cells. In particular, using a synthetic biology-based approach, we developed a protein delivery system composed of three discrete parts: (1) the machine, composed of the operons required for a functional T3SS from, (2) the activator, one of the regulators of T3SS expression, and (3) the substrates, target proteins fused to an N-terminal type 3 secretion sequences that promote their secretion without perturbing their activity. When these three parts are coexpressed in, the result is a nonpathogenic strain that can express, secrete and deliver a variety of heterologous proteins into mammalian cells (Figure). Importantly, this delivery system is easily adaptable for a variety of biotechnological purposes, as the type 3 activator and target protein expression constructs can be propagated in the delivery strain on separate but compatible plasmids that can be easily interchanged.",

To accomplish this, we chose to introduce the type 3 secretion apparatus from the phylogenetically related Shigella into. In Shigella, the genes needed for a functional secretion system, as well as almost all of its secreted substrates, are present on a large 220 kb plasmid, referred to as the Shigella virulence plasmid. The genes encoding the majority of secreted effectors are dispersed throughout the virulence plasmid, whereas those needed to form the type 3 secretion apparatus are contained in a series of large adjacent operons encompassing \u223c31 kb of DNA (Supporting Information Figure S2).

Several features of the vector backbone of pmT3SS enable the transfer of this large 44 kb plasmid between bacteria as well as the stable integration of the Shigella operons that it carries onto the chromosome. First, the backbone of pmT3SS includes an origin of transfer region (oriT) to facilitate the transfer of this plasmid from one strain background to another via conjugation. Second, the region of the Shigella operons present on pmT3SS is flanked on each end by a defined \u201clanding pad\u201d sequence such that this region of DNA can be integrated onto the chromosome of engineered to have the corresponding \u201clanding pad\u201d sequence. In this manner, the methodology developed by Kuhlman and Cox was adapted to add large captured regions of DNA at specific chromosomal loci, an approach that can be easily adapted to capture other large pieces of DNA. The introduction of mT3SS into the chromosome alleviates the need for antibiotic selection, thus resulting in a strain, mT3, that should be particularly well-suited for use as an in vivo therapeutic protein delivery system.",

All type 3 effectors are defined by an N-terminal secretion sequence (SS) present within their first \u223c30 residues that is characterized as an intrinsically disordered structural motif rather than a defined amino acid sequence. In addition, many, but not all, effectors bind a chaperone, an interaction needed for delivery into host cells. Downstream from their N-terminal secretion sequences, these effectors contain a chaperone binding domain (CBD) within their first 50\u2013100 amino acid residues. Limited studies in Yersinia and Salmonella suggest that fusion of the first 15\u201320 residues of an effector to a heterologous protein is sufficient to generate a secreted substrate, although these proteins are generally only poorly delivered into mammalian cells.

MyoD was chosen as the model protein for this analysis given that it is recognized as a type 3 secreted substrate by the T3SS when fused to the first 54 residues of one of its effectors. To rapidly generate secretion sequence\u2013MyoD (SS-MyoD) fusion proteins, we developed a Gateway-recombination compatible MyoD destination vector (Supporting Information Figure S4b). The construct is designed such that a flexible glycine\u2013serine linker is present between the SS and MyoD to minimize potential issues with steric hindrance (Figure a). Plasmids that conditionally express each of these SS\u2013MyoD fusion proteins were introduced into mT3_virF endo, and secretion was assessed. Fusion of MyoD to 50 but not 30 residues of all effectors tested, both chaperone-dependent and-independent, resulted in fusion proteins recognized as secreted substrates by mT3 (Figure b,c). However, only a subset of the secreted variants was detected within extracts of mammalian cells exposed to the same bacterial strains (Figure d), suggesting that the different secretion sequences differ in their translocation efficiencies. While some correlation was observed between the levels of SS\u2013MyoD secreted into the media and delivered into host cells, this was not always the case, suggesting that additional factors, e.g., protein stability, might play a role in regulating protein levels after delivery into host cells.",

Of the 11 sequences included within our library, only the N-terminal 50 residues of one, OspF, is currently known to encode a functional domain. To investigate potential phenotypes conferred by fusion to specific individual secretion sequences, we compared the activity of the 11 SS\u2013MyoD variants that are recognized as secreted substrates (Figure c) using myogenic differentiation assays. Given the observed differences in the levels of each delivered fusion protein into host cells via type 3 secretion, we compared the functional activity of each variant by assessing their ability to promote myogenic reprogramming and differentiation when directly expressed in 10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblast cells. As shown in Figure a, we observed a large variation in myogenic activity. Fusion to some secretion sequences such as those from IpaH7.8 and OspG reproducibly exhibited myogenic activity equivalent to or greater than that of native MyoD, whereas others, including those from OspE, OspF, and VirA, ablated MyoD activity. Of note, for these experiments, we compared the activity of wild-type MyoD to SS\u2013MyoD (S200A), a variant that carries a mutation known to increase MyoD stability and activity. The use of this variant may account for the increased myogenic potential observed with several of the modified fusion proteins.",

To assess the relative stabilities of the MyoD fusion proteins, we compared the steady-state levels of wild-type and modified MyoD in 10T1/2 cell lysates 24 h post-transfection. We found a correlation between the steady-state level of a particular modified MyoD protein and its myogenic activity (Figure a,c). For example, fusion proteins with low myogenic activity, e.g., SS OspE \u2013MyoD, exhibited low or undetectable steady-state expression levels, whereas fusion proteins with higher myogenic activity, e.g. SS IpaH7.8 \u2013MyoD, exhibited higher steady-state levels. Thus, at least in these cases, we have identified reasons to explain the loss of mammalian protein activity due to fusion to a type 3 secretion sequence, demonstrating that protein stability and activity need to be investigated when selecting the ideal type 3 secretion sequence to fuse to a heterologous protein.

As shown in Figure a,b, mT3_virF endo and mT3_virB IPTG but not mT3 can invade epithelial cells. This is not surprising given that the 31 kb region of the Shigella DNA present in mT3 contains three Shigella effectors (IpgB1, IpgD, and IpaA, Supporting Information Figure S2) reported to play a role in the invasion of Shigella into host cells. However, these strains replicate very poorly, if at all, within mammalian cells (Figure b). These results are consistent with early studies demonstrating that that carry a cosmid containing 45 kb of the Shigella virulence plasmid, which includes the 31 kb present in mT3, invade but do not replicate within HeLa cells.

The modular nature of these strains provides not only flexibility in substrate selection but also the ability to control the activity of the protein delivery system as well as expression of its substrates. In these studies, we used an IPTG-inducible lac promoter to drive expression of VirB, which successfully led to secretion and delivery of target proteins. However, this promoter could easily be exchanged for a synthetic promoter that responds to an exogenously added small molecule or for an endogenous bacterial promoter that is induced under conditions present within certain diseased tissues and/or organs, i.e., the microaerophilic environment within solid tumors or the inflammatory milieu of the intestines of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Similarly, the pmT3SS plasmid contains the features needed to change host strains quickly via conjugation if, for example, the target protein is not expressed well or is unstable in DH10\u03b2 or if a commensal or flagellated bacterial host strain is desired. Thus far, the pmT3SS plasmid has been successfully transferred via conjugation into a variety of genetic backgrounds including DH5\u03b1, BL-21, and HB101 (data not shown). In addition, we have developed and validated a screening platform that can rapidly identify those secretion sequences that not only promote the delivery of heterologous proteins but also maintain their activity when delivered into host cells. On the basis of our ability to generate variants of several mammalian proteins that are recognized as secreted substrates, we anticipate that a wide variety of proteins can be modified by a type 3 secretion sequence and delivered into mammalian cells by these bacterial strains.",

Similarly, the residual invasive activity of mT3 could be a useful mechanism for expressing and delivering foreign antigens into the cytoplasm of antigen-presenting cells, thereby facilitating its development as a potential vaccine vector to protect against various infectious diseases or cancers. Conversely, for applications such as cellular reprogramming, in which invasion of mammalian cells may not be desirable, mT3 invasion can likely be reduced or eliminated by removing the few remaining effectors present in the 31 kb region of the Shigella virulence plasmid present. Alternatively, the addition of a lysis device that ruptures any bacteria that do manage to invade a mammalian cell could easily be incorporated. Lastly, prior to introduction into patients, these bacterial strains will need to be engineered to encode \u201ckill switches\u201d or modifications that prevent the propagation or release of protein delivery strains in the environment. Although, notably, it has been previously demonstrated that K12 strains that carry the entire 220 kb Shigella virulence plasmid are completely avirulent in animal models of disease, likely due to the absence of multiple chromosomally encoded Shigella virulence determinants.

(2) A PCR-amplified product with homology to the 1000 bp of sequence upstream of the ipaJ open reading frame (ORF) amplified from purified Shigella virulence plasmid DNA, (3) a PCR product with homology to the spa40 ORF, and (4) a PCR fragment amplified from the vector pLLX8, which encodes the ampicillin-resistance gene cassette, bla.

The bla carrying fragment from pLLX8 was amplified with primers that provide homology to the IpaJ upstream region and spa40 ORF. The flanking homology on these DNA sequences enables their assembly by homologous recombination when cotransformed into competent. The following amounts of transformed DNA yielded successful recombination: 200 ng each of the Shigella specific PCR products (ipaJ and spa40), 600 ng of the pLLX8-derived bla PCR product, and 100 ng of linearized pLLX13. Recombined plasmids were harvested from yeast by pooling all transformant colonies using a Qiagen miniprep kit modified by including a lysis step in which the harvested yeast were vortexed for 5 min the presence of glass beads.

Initially, DH10\u03b2 was transformed with helper plasmid pTKRED, which harbors genes encoding the \u03bb-Red enzymes and I-SceI endonuclease. Then, the DH10\u03b2 genome was modified at the atp1/gidB locus with the insertion of a 1.3 kb landing pad integration site: a tetracycline-resistance gene (tetA) flanked by I-SceI recognition sites and 25 bp landing pad regions. Successful landing pad integrants were screened for tetracycline resistance, and integration into the proper location was confirmed by PCR. This strain was then transformed with pmT3SS. The T3SS genes and landing pad regions were excised from the plasmid by I-SceI digestion and incorporated into the genome via recombination at the landing pad regions at the atp1/gidB locus. KAN-resistant/TET-susceptible transformants were screened for proper integration of the 31 kb T3SS DNA and sequenced.",

Gateway reactions were used to generate the TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase and MyoD fusion proteins flanked by attB sites. To generate the secretion signal library, PCRs were performed that amplified the first 150 bp (50 amino acids) of a Shigella effector and added a 5\u2032 Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG) and 3\u2032 sequence homologous to a flexible poly glycine linker. Each insert was sequence-verified and subsequently transferred into Gateway destination vectors pDSW206 (bacterial expression vector, ColE1 ori, ampicillin resistant), containing the MyoD open reading frame, or into the low-copy gateway destination vector, pNG162-ccdB-TEM-1 (spectinomycin resistant). Sewing PCRs were used to generate the mammalian expression constructs and fusion proteins with iPS and cardiac reprogramming factors. The first PCR amplified the secretion signal as described above. The second PCR product amplified the mammalian protein open reading frame and 5\u2032 homology to the polyglycine linker and 3\u2032 attB site. The two PCRs were there sewn together in another round of PCR. The amplified genes were then introduced into pDNR221 via BP reactions (Invitrogen). Each insert was sequence-verified and subsequently transferred into Gateway destination vector pDEST47 (mammalian expression vector, pCMV promoter, ampicillin resistant) (Addgene) or bacterial expression vector pDSW206-ccdB-FLAG. The pDSW206-OspB-TEM (\u03b2-lactamase) fusion protein plasmid was used as previously described. The TAL expression plasmid was generated by cloning the open reading frame from pEF1-VP64-TALE into Sac I/Hin dIII-digested pDSW206-FLAG. Secretion sequences were amplified by PCR and ligated into the SacI site of pDSW206-TALE using Gibson assembly master mix (New England Biolabs). To generate the IPTG-inducible virB plasmid, pNG162-virB, the virB open reading frame was amplified using oligos that added a 5\u2032 Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence and flanking attB sites for Gateway site-specific recombination cloning. The PCR was introduced into pDNR221 by BP reaction and subsequently transferred into the low-copy gateway destination vector, pNG162-ccdB. All oligonucleotide primers used in these constructs are listed in Supporting Information Table S1.",

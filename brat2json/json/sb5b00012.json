        "Programmable control over an addressable global regulator would enable simultaneous repression of multiple genes and would have tremendous impact on the field of synthetic biology. It has recently been established that CRISPR/Cas systems can be engineered to repress gene transcription at nearly any desired location in a sequence-specific manner, but there remain only a handful of applications described to date. In this work, we report development of a vector possessing a CRISPathBrick feature, enabling rapid modular assembly of natural type II-A CRISPR arrays capable of simultaneously repressing multiple target genes in. Iterative incorporation of spacers into this CRISPathBrick feature facilitates the combinatorial construction of arrays, from a small number of DNA parts, which can be utilized to generate a suite of complex phenotypes corresponding to an encoded genetic program. We show that CRISPathBrick can be used to tune expression of plasmid-based genes and repress chromosomal targets in probiotic, virulent, and commonly engineered strains. Furthermore, we describe development of pCRISPReporter, a fluorescent reporter plasmid utilized to quantify dCas9-mediated repression from endogenous promoters. Finally, we demonstrate that dCas9-mediated repression can be harnessed to assess the effect of downregulating both novel and computationally predicted metabolic engineering targets, improving the yield of a heterologous phytochemical through repression of endogenous genes. These tools provide a platform for rapid evaluation of multiplex metabolic engineering interventions."

            "text": "Selective and tunable perturbation of gene expression is a fundamental enabling technology in the fields of systems biology and synthetic biology, allowing the design of intricate synthetic circuits and the interrogation of complex natural biological systems. Until recently, however, there has been a paucity of tools to dynamically regulate transcription at the DNA level in a rapid, predictable, and specific manner. In the past, natural DNA-binding proteins have been harnessed by targeting to their cognate protein-binding sequences, artificially placed upstream or downstream of natural promoter sequences, to achieve transcriptional activation or repression; however, this method necessitates the addition of a static DNA element, or operator, near the promoter of interest. This is especially problematic for regulation of endogenous genes since it requires genome engineering, a burdensome task for simultaneous manipulation of multiple targets. Conversely, programmable transcription factor (TF) proteins like zinc fingers and transcription activator like effectors (TALEs) have been utilized to target both natural and artificial DNA sequences for transcription modulation, but construction and selection of TFs are cumbersome processes that yield a TF capable of binding only a single target site. More elegant solutions for transcriptional regulation have been engineered using noncoding RNA (ncRNA) in a few noteworthy instances, but, with the exception of a recent report, these systems have suffered from limited predictability, design complexity, and a small dynamic range. While translational repression can be achieved with other technologies like antisense RNA (asRNA), complex biological programs can benefit from, and might necessitate, multilevel interactions among RNA, DNA, and regulatory proteins, providing a strong argument for developing tools that can readily control transcription.",

Natural CRISPR/Cas systems are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems that target foreign DNA for cleavage, mediated by a class of endonucleases whose nuclease specificity is guided by Watson\u2013Crick base-pairing complementarity of a ncRNA guide with the target nucleic acid. This highly specific and predictable targeting mechanism has been exploited to convert CRISPR nucleases into ncRNA-guided DNA-binding proteins through mutation of catalytic residues in endonuclease domains, yielding addressable protein\u2013RNA platforms for engineering artificial transcription factors and other devices. Due to the limited number of interacting parts required at the targeting stage of immunity compared to type I and type III CRISPR/Cas systems, the model type II-A system from was the first to be engineered for transcriptional silencing. Mutations D10A of RuvC and H840A of HNH endonuclease domains in Cas9 (forming mutant dCas9), the sole RNA-guided dsDNA endonuclease in this system, abolished nuclease activity but maintained sequence-specific dsDNA-binding capability, a property of dCas9 that has been utilized to achieve transcriptional repression at endogenous promoters through promoter occlusion from RNA polymerase (RNAP) and abortion of transcription elongation (referred to as CRISPR interference, or CRISPRi). Two recent reports also demonstrated engineering of the orthogonal type I-E CRISPR/Cas system from for gene silencing.",

            "text": "The type II-A CRISPR/Cas system is composed of interacting elements that can be generally classified by their involvement in either the adaptation or targeting stage of immunity. Elements involved in the adaptive immunity stage, where natural target DNA sequences are detected and incorporated into a genomic locus known as the CRISPR array, are described in detail elsewhere. The following constituents of the targeting stage of immunity are required for targeted cleavage of foreign dsDNA in the natural system: Cas9, precursor CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA), transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA), and RNase III. Pre-crRNA is a ncRNA transcript of the CRISPR array, an ordered arrangement of \u223c30 bp \u201cspacer\u201d sequences (memory of challenge from exogenous nucleic acid) uniformly interspersed with a 36 bp \u201crepeat\u201d sequence (Figure). Spacer sequences are identical to the complement of the 30 bp target dsDNA sequence known as the protospacer, which must be immediately flanked at the 3\u2032 end by a 3 bp NGG sequence referred to as the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in order to anchor Cas9 to the target site. Protospacers are sampled from exogenous DNA and incorporated as novel spacers in CRISPR arrays through a process called adaptation, where spacer acquisition is controlled by many factors including an indispensable AT-rich region known as the leader sequence and encoded immediately upstream of the first spacer. In a process referred to as biogenesis, an antirepeat sequence within tracrRNA molecules base pairs with pre-crRNA repeats, forming RNA duplexes that are subsequently cleaved into stable crRNA:tracrRNA duplexes by RNase III and trimmed in a less well-characterized process called maturation. Complexes of Cas9 with individually processed, mature crRNA:tracrRNA duplexes possessing 20 bp of spacer sequence are then guided to cognate dsDNA for target cleavage by Cas9 (or target binding in the case of dCas9). Maturation of crRNA:tracrRNA is presumably unaffected by replacement of Cas9 with dCas9, and in such a system, the dCas9:crRNA:tracrRNA complex binds to its cognate target without cleavage. In the CRISPRi system, dCas9 is guided to its target by an artificial ncRNA that mimics the crRNA:tracrRNA duplex, known as a single-guide RNA (sgRNA); each sgRNA must be transcribed under control of its own promoter and terminator, although creative cloning strategies have been devised to achieve expression of multiple sgRNAs. Notably, Cas9-mediated cleavage and dCas9-mediated repression at spacer sequences within the CRISPR array are not possible because of the absence of the requisite PAM at the 3\u2032 end of each spacer.",

            "text": "Recently, Bikard et al. described construction of a type II-A CRISPR/dCas9 (specifically, CRISPR02 from SF370) system capable of targeting only a single site in at a time. The topology of natural CRISPR arrays imposes unique design constraints that are irrelevant in most other cloning procedures but that must be given careful attention here to ensure modularity, to prevent improper biogenesis, and to guarantee successful targeting of dCas9:crRNA:tracrRNA complexes. As the target address is encoded within the 30 bp spacer region, this DNA element must maintain fidelity and cannot be altered to incorporate restriction enzyme cut sites. Furthermore, effects of varying the 36 bp repeat sequence are not completely understood; alterations in the crRNA:tracrRNA complementarity region would presumably have deleterious effects on maturation and would likely hinder dCas9 functionality and perturb orthogonality. We therefore sought to devise an assembly strategy that leaves all repeat regions and targeting spacers intact. Another constraint, which complicates modular construction with newer sequence homology-directed assembly techniques, like Gibson Assembly, sequence-and ligase-independent cloning (SLIC), and circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC), is that CRISPR repeat sequences within all DNA parts are identical and would likely make maintenance of intended order difficult to achieve, leading to an intolerable degree of misassemblies. Moreover, an added disadvantage of such assembly methods is that part termini (overlap regions) should not possess palindromic sequences or thermodynamically stable ssDNA secondary structure, a property that could prove to be problematic when constructing CRISPR arrays in a modular manner due to the presence of stable hairpins in some type I and II CRISPR repeats. Finally, despite rapidly decreasing costs for DNA synthesis, parts containing complexity (repeated sequences, elements with high propensity for hairpin formation, or highly negative \u0394 G) are not amenable to many synthesis technologies; thus, even short repetitive parts like CRISPR arrays cannot yet be synthesized as inexpensive, on-demand products like gBlocks (IDT), and the cost of direct synthesis of combinatorial libraries is likely prohibitive for many laboratories. The procedure, presented herein, avoids the aforementioned obstacles for assembly of CRISPR arrays that are indistinguishable from those in natural type II-A systems with respect to organization and preservation of the wild-type leader sequence, natural repeat sequences, and user-specified spacer sequences.",

            "text": "Specifically, we have designed CRISPathBrick as a restriction\u2013ligation cloning procedure that takes advantage of a unique nontargeting spacer, in the last position of the array, possessing a single BsaI (Type IIS endonuclease with a nonpalindromic, directional recognition sequence) recognition site near the 3\u2032 end of the bottom strand. As seen in Figure, the BsaI cut site lies outside of its recognition site and instead directs cleavage to the anterior repeat. New spacer\u2013repeat elements are synthesized in offset complementary pairs of ssDNA oligonucleotides (66 bp), where the 5\u2032 phosphorylated and annealed spacer\u2013repeat oligos, hereto referred to as spacer\u2013repeat brick (SRB), possess incompatible 4 bp overhangs (sticky ends) to facilitate directional cloning as popularized by assembly methods like Golden Gate cloning that use Type IIS endonucleases to maintain orientation of inserts. Ligation of the pCRISPathBrick vector backbone with the upstream end of the SRB creates a scarless junction that remains permanently locked; conversely, ligation of the backbone with the downstream end of the SRB reforms the entry junction, identical to that of the original destination vector, which can be cyclically redigested by BsaI. In this manner, single SRBs can be iteratively incorporated into the growing array in a modular fashion analogous to ePathBrick (Figure), furnishing expandable arrays with no intervening restriction sites. Importantly, CRISPathBrick arrays are identical to natural Type II-A CRISPR arrays with the exception of the final, nontargeting BsaI spacer that facilitates cloning, an advantage that this procedure holds over other potential assembly methods. Although our intent is to study effects of transcriptional repression, we expect that this methodology could prove to be useful for others seeking to study adaptation and spacer acquisition in engineered arrays.",

To facilitate the CRISPathBrick cloning procedure, as described above, the original junk (placeholder) spacer was swapped with a new nontargeting spacer possessing a single BsaI recognition site. It is important to note that this nontargeting spacer was designed so that no significant matches were found in the genomes of commonly engineered chassis strains BL21 and K-12 MG1655 to preclude inadvertent repression caused by guidance of dCas9 by the nontargeting crRNA. Spacers intended for repression were designed with two simple constraints: the corresponding 30 bp protospacer must be followed by the NGG PAM, a motif that is ubiquitous throughout the genome of all strains and within or in close proximity to most promoters (especially if both strands are considered), and, whenever possible, the protospacers should be matching in all strains that will be tested. SRBs identical to individual protospacers of interest were sequentially incorporated into the expanding pCRISPathBrick array and combined as desired through iterative rounds of restriction digestion and ligation, enabling customizable configuration of target sets and rapid manufacture of defined libraries. For example, three SRBs targeting distinct promoters can be assembled into an exhaustive array library composed of all seven (2 n \u2013 1; the sum of combinations excluding the empty set and ignoring order) possible combinations in only three rounds of cloning (Figure). In this case, three constructs targeting three different promoters are assembled during the first round of cloning. For the second round of cloning, a subset of these arrays are appended with a unique SRB to form all possible double combinations, while the full three-target array is assembled in the third and final round from a double-target array and the last SRB. Construction of three-target comprehensive libraries can be achieved in less than 1 week using colony PCR (cPCR) to screen for positive clones from each round of ligation. As each stage of cloning builds upon constructs from the previous round, however, sequencing each round is advisible to ensure insert fidelity throughout the process. Given the small insert size and low plasmid copy number, we opted to screen ligations using cPCR. Incorporation of a single SRB was accompanied by a concomitant increase in cPCR amplicon size of 66 bp (Figure).",

In certain instances, however, strain background can cause unexpected device output, so the option to quickly transfer a single device between distinct chassis is advantageous in the search for a suitable system. More recent assembly methods that enable overexpression of multiple genes and entire biosynthetic pathways from a single plasmid would be ideally complemented by a system enabling facile repression of numerous targets that can be rapidly programmed on a single plasmid and transferred to any strain of interest. Thus, to determine if CRISPathBrick is capable of achieving high levels of transcriptional repression in diverse strain backgrounds, we first assessed dCas9-mediated transcriptional repression of a plasmid-borne fluorescent reporter in two different strains (Figure b). Subsequently, repression was compared between plasmid-borne and genome-integrated fluorescent reporter in a single strain (Figure c). In each case, we utilized the same model fluorescent reporter cassette, T7-mCherry, previously built in our lab and composed of codon-optimized mCherry under transcriptional control of the IPTG-inducible P T7lac promoter and T7 terminator; this cassette was constructed using ePathBrick to facilitate transfer between platforms (plasmid vs genome) and chassis, keeping all transcriptional and translational control elements constant. Notably, transcription from T7 promoters is controlled by T7 RNA polymerase, a single-subunit polymerase that is structurally and evolutionarily divergent from the larger, multisubunit prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases. As genes under transcriptional control of T7 promoters are known to be expressed at a very high rate in relative to endogenous genes, we sought to determine the capacity of CRISPathBrick to repress transcription from this commonly utilized, high-strength promoter.",

Various spacers were designed because it has been shown that dCas9-mediated repression can be tuned by changing target location. The most common strategies for tuning dCas9-mediated repression include the following: titrating expression level of CRISPR machinery using an inducer, where higher levels of expression can lead to higher repression activity but can also cause toxicity; altering target location, where distance from promoter and repression activity generally have an inverse relationship; targeting the coding or noncoding strand, where targeting the coding strand typically achieves better repression; and encoding mismatches in the crRNA with respect to its target, which relieves repression relative to a crRNA that is identical to its protospacer. As shown in Figure b, comparable repression levels were achieved against IPTG-induced, T7 polymerase driven transcription in both chassis, and dual targeting of two nearby sites with a double-target array increased repression of the reporter. This is consistent with previous reports indicating that dCas9-mediated repression, at two nearby sites, enhances repression compared to targeting each site separately. Critical to the value of CRISPathBrick, this augmented repression indicates successful processing of multispacer synthetic type II-A arrays in divergent strains and simultaneous binding of dCas9 at two distinct locations within the same nucleic acid. It is noteworthy that the effective number of simultaneous binding sites in a single cell for a double-target array is much higher than two since the reporter is expressed from a high-copy plasmid (\u223c40 copies per cell); thus, the synergistic repression with the dual-targeting constructs suggests that dCas9 was successfully guided to approximately \u223c80 physical binding sites.",

Deletion from the genome of kpsT, part of an ABC membrane transporter required for translocation of certain CPSs to the outer membrane, is known to prevent export and to cause accumulation of CPS in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the promoter P kpsM has been shown to transcribe through the heparosan biosynthetic gene cluster, so we anticipated that repression of this promoter would lead to reduction of heparosan production and secretion, qualitatively assessed as loss of capsule. It is noteworthy that dCas9-mediated repression should block expression of all proteins encoded in the operon downstream of the target site, unless there are intermediate promoters located downstream that can drive transcription of the following genes in the operon. The genomes of K5 and Nissle 1917 were sequenced, and a single spacer targeting P kpsM was designed in a region conserved between the two strains as determined by pairwise alignment in the promoter region. This spacer was incorporated into pCRISPathBrick, which was then transformed into K5 and Nissle 1917. pCRISPathBrick possessing only the nontargeting BsaI spacer was transformed into both strains as a negative control. While K5 and Nissle 1917 grow in planktonic culture, heparosan is shed into the media by a combination of shear force and natural hydrolysis, enabling quantification of CPS production and export by analysis of the culture supernatant. As exhibited in Figure, significant attenuation of capsule production was achieved for both K5 and Nissle 1917 compared to their respective control strains. These important results suggest that a single CRISPathBrick plasmid could be used as a tool to study host\u2013pathogen and host\u2013commensal interactions in a set of distinct wild-type strains sharing a particular virulence factor. We also expect that variations of this technology incorporating inducible or dynamically controlled arrays will create new paradigms for transient studies of host\u2013pathogen interactions mediated by panels of virulence factors.",

In the absence of an observable or quantifiable phenotype corresponding to repression by a defined part, such as a single SRB, synthetic biologists must devise some metric to assess part quality. To date, dCas9-mediated repression of endogenous genes and promoters has primarily been evaluated by quantification of mRNA from the CDS of interest using qRT-PCR or RNA-seq. It is likely, however, that mRNA quantification is not accurate for assessment of functional protein expression in some cases because it accounts for neither translation initiation rate, thought to be the rate-limiting step in protein expression, nor unforeseen translational regulatory elements. Indeed, for many applications it would be more useful to evaluate repression in terms of protein quantity. Therefore, we have developed the fluorescent reporter plasmid pCRISPReporter along with a simple workflow to characterize individual SRBs in terms of protein abundance repression, a metric that should be more meaningful for immediately practical applications like metabolic engineering and for building predictable devices with protein-based parts. The procedure outlined here involves transfer of the promoter of interest and all surrounding endogenous transcriptional and translational control elements, from the start of the known operon through several N-terminal amino acids encoded in the CDS of interest, to the reporter plasmid to create a translational fusion of the front of the protein of interest with a fluorescent reporter protein. Assessment of repression of a gene in its genomic context is imperative when dealing with uncharacterized operons where potential for transcriptional read-through from unknown upstream promoters exists. Moreover, encompassing regions around the promoter leaves natural transcriptional regulator protein binding sites intact. The primary advantage over other methodologies that simply clone the promoter of interest upstream of an artificial CDS is that, with the CRISPReporter approach, translation initiation rate of the fluorescent reporter fusion should more accurately match that of the endogenous protein since the ribosome binding site (RBS) and regions primarily controlling translation initiation rate (5\u2032 untranslated region through the N-terminal region of the CDS) are captured in the cloning process.",

A PCR amplicon containing the N-terminal region of pgk downstream of gene epd and its promoter, P epd, was cloned into the MCS of pCRISPReporter-mCherry because no intervening terminator is known to exist between epd and pgk. Although there are three known promoters (P pgk1\u20133) immediately preceding the pgk CDS, PGK is also encoded as part of the bicistronic transcript epd\u2013pgk. Thus, accurate characterization of an SRB targeted to pgk requires accounting repression of lumped transcription from all of these promoters. A spacer was designed to bind the pgk CDS rather than the promoter, with the intent of achieving only intermediate transcriptional repression of this essential gene without significantly hindering growth.

As the sole gene in its transcript, FadR is monocistronic and is immediately preceded by promoter P fadR, although experimental evidence exists for a second transcriptional start site 10 bp downstream of the +1 site of P fadR. Thus, the region sufficiently far upstream of the first promoter P fadR through several amino acids into the front end of the fadR CDS was cloned into the MCS of pCRISPReporter-mCherry, and an SRB designed to bind the top strand at a site overlapping both experimentally characterized +1 sites was cloned into pCRISPathBrick.

The prevailing strategy to accomplish this goal has been rational selection of gene overexpression and deletion targets guided by pathway inspection. Increasingly, however, metabolic models are used to computationally identify genetic interventions required to meet a mathematically defined objective function, such as increased production of a target metabolite. CRISPathBrick is ideally suited as an alternative to achieving multiple gene deletions in a single strain for metabolic engineering because exploratory and model-guided repression of a set of endogenous genes (and all combinations) can be rapidly assessed in different chassis. Moreover, CRISPathBrick is particularly suitable for validation of predictions from contemporary algorithms that are formulated to specify intermediate gene downregulation levels required for maximum production. Another potential benefit of dCas9-mediated transcriptional repression over translational silencing strategies like antisense RNA is the polarity of CRISPR repression; that is, all genes downstream and under control of the silenced promoter are similarly repressed. As genes encoding related enzymes in metabolic pathways are often grouped into operons, which are frequently transcribed as polycistronic mRNA due to the lack of intervening terminators, targeting a single promoter could silence many or all of the critical enzymes in a biosynthetic pathway. Conversely, the disadvantage is that genes downstream of the target will be repressed if there is no intervening promoter, which could be problematic when downstream genes are essential, unrelated to the pathway of interest, or required for any other reason.",

Three genes from the heterologous flavonoid pathway encoding the enzymes 4-coumaroyl-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase (4CL) from and chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone isomerase (CHI) from were synthesized and assembled into a single vector using the ePathBrick assembly procedure for conversion of p-coumaric acid to naringenin in (Figure a). This is an interesting pathway (Supporting Information Figure S1) because endogenous pools of free CoA and malonyl-CoA must be co-opted by 4CL and CHS, respectively, drawing valuable precursors away from large endogenous sink pathways like fatty acid biosynthesis. Indeed, malonyl-CoA has been proven to be the limiting factor in microbial flavonoid production. We first selected FadR as a novel target for improving naringenin production because it is a DNA-binding transcriptional dual-regulator that exerts negative control over fatty acid degradation (\u03b2-oxidation) and positively regulates fatty acid biosynthesis. Therefore, we speculated that 10-fold repression of FadR as exhibited by CRISPReporter would lead to increased accumulation of malonyl-CoA through reduction in fatty-acid production and of acetyl-CoA, the precursor of malonyl-CoA, as a \u03b2-oxidation product, thus driving greater yield of naringenin. Recently published work using evolution-guided genome mutagenesis to select for high-production phenotypes supports this notion, as strains with improved naringenin production capacity exhibited a propensity for mutations attenuating translation rate of genes in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. As hypothesized, FadR repression improved naringenin production by approximately 64% (from 7.6 to 12.5 mg/L) over the control strain possessing pCRISPathBrick with a nontargeting array (Figure d).",

Specifically, repression of fumarase (FumC) is thought to reduce carbon flux through the TCA cycle, whereas repression of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SucC or SucD) and propionyl-CoA:succinyl-CoA transferase (ScpC) should limit consumption of CoA for byproduct formation, freeing CoA for utilization by pyruvate dehydrogenase during oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. The spacer of the first SRB was designed to target the promoter P sucA, which drives expression of operon sucABCD encoding subunits of both the succinyl-CoA synthetase complex and the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (SucAB). Repression of the entire operon is expected to be consistent with the objective, as both encoded enzymes utilize CoA for undesired formation of succinyl-CoA. The second spacer targets promoter P fumC1 to repress the monocistronic fumC transcript, and the third spacer targets the start of the scpC CDS, which, as the last gene in its operon, should not affect transcription of surrounding genes. Simultaneous repression of all three targets from a single CRISPR array yielded 18.9 mg/L naringenin, a 2.5-fold improvement in production over the nontargeting control strain (Figure d).

We have also developed the CRISPReporter system to characterize repression activity of individual SRB modules. The selective, predictable nature of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated repression will undoubtedly make it an integral component of synthetic circuits for the foreseeable future, but the capacity to effortlessly perturb multiple endogenous targets simultaneously will be pivotal for studies in many disciplines, from the basic sciences to systems biology and metabolic engineering. Although our intent in this work was to direct dCas9 to unique target sites, it is conceivable that a single spacer could be designed to target more than one genomic site, each with a slightly different sequence, where binding strength and repression level would differ between sites as controlled by the number and location of mismatches between the mature crRNA spacer and similar target sequences. If such sites can be found proximal to PAMs, then dCas9-mediated repression at these locations could be an intriguing tool to explore metabolic space, and CRISPathBrick could be used to build arrays of anticonsensus spacers for synergistic repression at multiple disparate consensus sequence families. We further envision that the CRISPathBrick design principle can be extrapolated to build arrays for evolutionarily distinct CRISPR systems, enabling selective transient control over user-defined sets of endogenous genes, where each synthetic regulon is controlled by its own orthogonal master regulator. Cloning vectors pCRISPathBrick, pCRISPReporter, and pCRISPReporter-mCherry are available to the community through Addgene (plasmids #65006-65008).",

Specifically, BLASTN of all potential protospacers of the nontargeting spacer (the spacer sequence concatenated with each of four NGG PAMs: 5\u2032-TGAGAC\u00adCTGTCTC\u00adGGAAGC\u00adTCATAG\u00adGAC\u00adTC N GG-3\u2032, where N represents A/T/C/G) finds no BL21 or K-12 MG1655 genomic hits that are contiguous with the requisite PAM. The CRISPReporter cassette was synthesized as a gBlock (IDT; Supporting Information Table S5) and amplified with primers CRISPReporter_ApaI_F and CRISPReporter_SalI_R for ligation into ApaI/SalI sites of pETM6, inactivating the unneeded lacI, to form pCRISPathBrick. Codon-optimized mCherry was subcloned from pETM6-mCherry into NdeI/KpnI sites of the pCRISPReporter to form plasmid pCRISPReporter-mCherry. BL21 Star (DE3) genomic DNA (gDNA) was purified with an Invitrogen PureLink Genomic DNA minikit and used as a template for PCR amplification of genomic promoter regions. pCRISPReporter-FadR_mCherry_fusion was generated by cloning of the fadR promoter region, PCR amplified with primers fadR_prom_PacI_F and fadR_prom_XhoI_R, into PacI/XhoI sites of the MCS of pCRISPReporter-mCherry. Similarly, the epd\u2013pgk region was PCR amplified with primers pgk_prom_PacI_F and pgk_prom_XhoI_R for insertion into PacI/XhoI sites of the pCRISPReporter-mCherry MCS to create plasmid pCRISPReporter-PGK_mCherry_fusion. Three genes from the flavonoid pathway, 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (from, GenBank accession no. JN858959), chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase (both from, GenBank accession nos. GQ892059 and GU323285, respectively), were codon-optimized for expression in and synthesized by GenScript as shown in Supporting Information Table S5. These genes were sequentially subcloned from pUC57 to pETM6 in monocistronic configuration using the ePathBrick procedure as described by Xu and co-workers to yield plasmid pETM6-Vv4CL-m-CmCHS-m-CmCHI.",

Still, native HR machinery is not efficient enough for complex and marker-free genome engineering required for modern metabolic engineering. Here, we present a method for marker-free multiloci integration of in vivo assembled DNA parts. By the use of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated one-step double-strand breaks at single, double and triple integration sites we report the successful in vivo assembly and chromosomal integration of DNA parts. We call our method CasEMBLR and validate its applicability for genome engineering and cell factory development in two ways: (i) introduction of the carotenoid pathway from 15 DNA parts into three targeted loci, and (ii) creation of a tyrosine production strain using ten parts into two loci, simultaneously knocking out two genes. This method complements and improves the current set of tools available for genome engineering in S. cerevisiae.",

            "text": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae serves as a platform organism for functional genomics of eukaryotes and biobased production of an ever-increasing list of chemicals and fuels. The native homologous recombination (HR) machinery of S. cerevisiae has also allowed it to be used in diverse plasmid-based and chromosome integrative cloning efforts with appreciable efficiency. However, it is widely acknowledged that plasmid-based systems can be unstable, and for that reason genome integration is the preferred tactic for most current metabolic engineering efforts on multistep enzymatic pathway construction. Since the pioneering studies on integration of linear fragments with kb-sized homologous ends to chromosome integration sites published in the 1980s, the past two decades have witnessed a number of studies that have continued to develop and improve both HR-based in vivo assembly of DNA fragments and methods for genome integration of heterologous DNA.",

            "text": "Though yeast\u2019s native HR machinery efficiently recombines homologous sequences, the background efficiency for genome integration of linear DNA fragments in yeast without use of a selection marker is too low to be applicable for strain building. This is due to the fact that in vivo assembly supplies DNA fragments with open ends readily accessible for the HR machinery, but chromosomal integration of these fragments requires recombination of DNA fragments into intact genomic DNA, and is therefore far less likely to occur. As the original function of HR includes repairing double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in the genome, the efficiency of targeting DNA fragments to chromosomes by HR can be dramatically increased when a DSB is introduced into the genome during transformation. Using the inducible homing endonuclease I-SceI to target a DSB-mediated integration of a 95 bp linear DNA fragment restoring tryptophan prototrophy, recombination efficiencies of 5\u201320% were achieved. This number was approximately 4000-fold higher than recombination efficiencies without DSB-induced integration of DNA fragments as originally described for the delitto perfetto method. Likewise, in the CATI method (combined in vivo assembly and targeted chromosomal integration), Kuijpers et al. used I-SceI to induce a single DSB for homology-directed and marker-assisted targeting of 10\u201315 part assemblies with an efficiency of 95%, compared to merely 5% without the induction of I-SceI endonuclease activity.",

In the first reported example of genome engineering in yeast using CRISPR/Cas9, DiCarlo et al. showed that homology-directed repair of a Cas9-mediated DSB could be effectively obtained by cotransforming yeast with 90 bp double-stranded oligonucleotides (dsOligos) and plasmid-based expression of a guide RNA (gRNA). Because of the ease and versatility of RNA-based guiding of Cas9 endonuclease activity, CRISPR/Cas9 has continued to improve targeted genome engineering in yeast. This includes restoring uracil prototrophy by single-site integration of a three-part DNA assembly in a ura-strain, and the marker-free homology-directed knockout of multiple genes in one step using short (90\u2013120 bp) dsOligos. However, in order to leverage current genome engineering for robust and balanced multistep metabolic pathway integration in S. cerevisiae chromosomes, there is a continued need to further exploit the potential of both in vivo DNA assembly and CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex and marker-free genome engineering.",

            "text": "Before integrating this three-step pathway we first validated the efficiency of Cas9-mediated DSB and integration of in vivo assembled DNA into each individual locus selected for integration. For this purpose we cotransformed yeast expressing Cas9 with DNA for individual five-part in vivo assemblies and an episomal plasmid expressing a gRNA cassette to guide Cas9-mediated DSB at either ADE2, HIS3, or URA3 genomic sites. Mutant alleles of ade2 \u2013 and ura3 \u2013 colonies can be easily screened by color appearance of adenine-deficient colonies (pink) or selected by 5-FOA resistance counter-selection, respectively. However, for this proof-of-principle study, efficiencies reported from genotyping of correct assembly and integration of the individual expression cassettes were only based on the representative distribution of phenotypes of transformants (orange/pink/white) appearing on plates selected for Cas9 and gRNA expression (Trp +/Leu +) alone. For all integration loci, multiplex PCR of a minimum of 12 colonies per transformation was used to verify both correct assembly and integration, as the expression cassette and flanking sequences are too large (approximately 2.8\u20134.4 kb) to be efficiently amplified by a single primer pair during colony PCR. Consequently, colonies without integration of the five-part assembly would generate an amplicon with a size of approximately 1.1 kb from amplification of the native locus (Figure b), whereas a correct assembly and integration should yield two amplicons spanning all six junctions of the five-part assembly, including integration. This is exemplified for assembly and integration of the crtI, crtE and crtYB expression cassettes into sites URA3, HIS3, and ADE2, respectively (Figure b). For correct assembly and integration of the crtYB expression cassette in ADE2, positive genotyping results matched the pink ade2 \u2013 phenotype (Figure b,c).",

For assembly of crtYB into ADE2 without expressing gRNA, 0.2% of the colonies were pink (Figure c), but none of these had the correct genotype. Contrastingly, when cotransforming cells with DNA parts and a gRNA-expressing plasmid we observed substantial differences between the engineering efficiencies we obtained for correct assembly onto the individual loci. Based on genotyping, we obtained engineering efficiencies of 96 and 77% for in vivo assembly and integration of crtYB and crtE expression cassettes in ADE2 and URA3, respectively (Figure d), whereas for crtI integration into HIS3, we only obtained 14.6% (Figure d). Following marker-free assembly and integration of five DNA parts (i.e., one expression cassette) at single targeted chromosomal locus, we made a one-step transformation of Cas9-expressing S. cerevisiae with all 15 DNA parts to be assembled and integrated into the three chromosomal loci: URA3, HIS3, and ADE2. As for single site integrations, genotyping of colonies transformed without a multiplex gRNA plasmid for guiding Cas9 DSBs revealed no correct assemblies and integrations of the three carotenoid pathway gene expression cassettes into the targeted integration sites (Figure d). However, from colonies transformed with both DNA parts and the multiplex gRNA plasmid we obtained an average of 4.5% colonies with correctly assembled carotenoid pathway into the ADE2, HIS3 and URA3 loci (Figure d).",

            "text": "The single-site efficiencies obtained for assembly and integration into ADE2 and URA3 are comparable to those obtained from single-fragment integration to other loci using CRISPR/Cas9. This could indicate that assembly is not a limiting factor for high efficiency genome engineering using DNA parts, whereas the low engineering efficiency obtained for HIS3 could be associated with poor Cas9-mediated DSB induction, known to be critical for obtaining high engineering efficiencies. Further inspection of the 20 nt gRNA sequence guiding Cas9 to HIS3 site revealed a 5 nt motif 5\u2032-GGCCC-3\u2032 complementary to 5-GGGCC-3\u2032 positioned three nucleotides apart. Using the RNAfold web server, such complementarity is likely to cause secondary structure of the gRNA (Figure S1, Supporting Information), and thereby lowered guiding efficiency or increased off-targeting of Cas9. However, poor assembly of the crtI expression cassette could neither be ruled out as the reason for the modest efficiency obtained for this single-site engineering attempt. In order to check if suboptimal in vivo assembly of the crtI expression cassette was also affecting the engineering efficiency of crtI into HIS3, we targeted the in vivo assembly of crtI into the RNA-guided DSB of URA3. Here we observed an efficiency of 79.2% (Figure e), which is comparable to the efficiency obtained for assembly and integration of the crtE expression cassette into URA3 (Figure d). This indicates that S. cerevisiae \u2019s native capacity for homologous recombination does not have a sequence bias for the different expression cassette assemblies when using the parameters outlined in this study. In order to test if we could increase efficiency of carotenoid pathway construction using CasEMBLR by changing the HIS3 site, we selected a second gRNA target in HIS3 site (hereafter termed HIS3_2) using CRISPy. Transforming the five parts of the crtI expression cassette together with a gRNA expression plasmid guiding Cas9 to the HIS3_2 position we obtained an engineering efficiency of 79.2%, compared to 14.6% when using the former DSB in HIS3 as integration site (Figure d,e). In line with these results, we obtained an approximately 7-fold increase of the engineering efficiency when assembling the three-gene carotenoid pathway from 15 parts, using a triple gRNA expression plasmid targeting assemblies into the HIS3_2 site together with the formerly used ADE2 and URA3 sites (30.6 vs 4.5%, respectively) (Figure d,e).",

Also, to further advance the applicability of CasEMBLR for one-step genome engineering, we targeted assembly and integration of DNA parts into two chromosomal loci encoding genes of interest for simultaneous targeted knockout. For this purpose, we addressed the need for yeast cell factories with increased aromatic amino acid (AAA) precursors for improved production of a large number of fine and value-added chemicals including alkaloids and flavonoids. AAAs are synthesized via the shikimate pathway, starting with the condensation of erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) and phospho enol pyruvate (PEP) (Figure a). This reaction, catalyzed by 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase (ARO4), is allosterically inhibited by tyrosine or high concentrations of phenylalanine or tryptophan. Chorismate mutase (ARO7), another key enzyme for tyrosine and phenylalanine synthesis, is also feedback inhibited by tyrosine. Here, we aimed to relieve these feedback inhibitions on AAA biosynthesis by assembly of the two tyrosine-insensitive versions of ARO4 and ARO7 (hereafter referred to as ARO4* and ARO7*) (Figure a). To minimize the formation of byproduct in the Tyr/Phe branch, we targeted the integration of Tyr-insensitive ARO4* and ARO7* expression cassette assemblies into the PDC5 and ARO10 sites, respectively, encoding two decarboxylases earlier reported to have the highest decarboxylation rates of phenylpyruvate, a phenylethanol precursor and AAA biosynthesis competitor.",

Compared to other pioneering HR-based genome engineering methods like delitto perfetto and DNA Assembler, CRISPR/Cas9 is the only reported method that allows one-step efficient marker-free genome engineering (Table). Though the first reported application of CRISPR/Cas9 in yeast only targeted sites with selectable phenotypes, we and others have reported single-fragment integrations into multiple sites (1\u20135) without the use of markers or selectable phenotypes. Ideally, our previous successful CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering of five loci in one-step may allow for construction of larger metabolic pathways in yeast using CasEMBLR. Studies of the capacity for CasEMBLR in terms of numbers of integration sites and parts to be assembled are currently being performed in our laboratory. Still, with the present results, CasEMBLR is to the best of our knowledge the first reported method to combine in vivo DNA assembly and multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 for versatile strain design and building, while maintaining high engineering efficiencies for most of the targeted sites without the use of markers for assembly integration (Table; Figures d,e and d).",

However, the use of YIPs require flanking fragment ends (0.1\u20134 kb) to be constructed and cloned together with expression cassettes of interest, for each integration site in order to boost marker-assisted integration. Though CasEMBLR does not reply on YIPs, each integration site still requires a gRNA-expressing plasmid. However, construction of gRNA-expressing plasmids for single-site targeting only require the cyclic amplification of a donor plasmid using a set of primers with the needed 20 bp gRNA target sequences included, whereas multiplex gRNA plasmids require subcloning. Accordingly, this aspect still limits the use of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated high-throughput strain building, and several efforts are currently targeting the delivery and in vivo processing of gRNA in order to simplify further CRISPR/Cas9. Also, it should be mentioned that although the edits introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 and CasEMBLR are marker-free, plasmid-based expression of Cas9 and gRNA(s) requires markers. However, recycling of these are easily accomplished by a single restreaking of edited strains onto nonselective medium.",

When targeting multiloci integration, such discrepancies will naturally affect the overall success rate of genome engineering by CasEMBLR, which we also observe here (Figure d,e and Figure c,d). We therefore foresee a need to build more high-performing integration sites, like ADE2, HIS3_2, PDC5 and ARO10, for optimal coupling of one-step multiloci DSBs and integration of assembled DNA parts into such sites. Consequently, our current efforts seek to address this issue by screening and testing for favorable gRNAs targeting native and synthetic \u201clanding pads\u201d in the S. cerevisiae genome with highest possible specificity and genomic sequence divergence to boost targeting of assemblies and limit mis-integration due to sequence homology between donor ends and off-target chromosomal loci. Applying a set of high-performing \u201clanding pads\u201d together with a complementary set of multiplex gRNA expression plasmids will relieve the need for gRNA plasmid cloning and therefore increase throughput.",

Second, gRNA expression cassettes for all targeted loci were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies as gBlocks. Sequence of gRNA expression cassette was used as in DiCarlo et al. (2013). Third, gRNA cassettes were amplified with universal primers (TJOS-62, TJOS-63, TJOS-64, TJOS-65, TJOS-66, TJOS-67) to attach compatible ends for USER cloning. Finally, desired combinations of single (ADE2; URA3; HIS3; HIS3_2), double (PDC5-ARO10) and triple (ADE2-URA3-HIS3 and ADE2-URA3-HIS3_2) gRNA expression cassettes were constructed by USER cloning into an Asi SI-, Nb.Bsm I-digested pTAJAK-96 vector.",

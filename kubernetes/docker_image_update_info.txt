# To install any packages permamently in the docker image on nautilus cluster:
1. Pull the existing image that you use for any of the pod yaml files from docker hub
docker pull nakumgaurav/sbks:dev3

2. Create a container using that image and open a shell within the container
docker run -it --name="sbks_container" nakumgaurav/sbks:dev3 /bin/bash

3. Install the required packages in the container
apt-get install <package>

4. Without exiting the container, open a new terminal shell and commit the changes in a new image (or a new image tag)
docker commit -m="installed <packages>" sbks_container nakumgaurav/sbks:dev4
(this command must be issued from the host machine)
You can now exit the container

5. Push the new image to the registry
docker push nakumgaurav/sbks:dev4

6. Delete the container
docker rm sbks_container

7. Remove the previous image
docker rmi nakumgaurav/sbks:dev3

Optionally, to ensure older pod/job specifications remain valid:
8. Retag image:
docker tag nakumgaurav/sbks:dev4 nakumgaurav/sbks:dev3

9. Remove new tag:
docker rmi nakumgaurav/sbks:dev4

(If for some reason, the tag of an image is <none>, run "docker images" to get the Image ID of the image and then run "docker rmi <IMAGE-ID>".

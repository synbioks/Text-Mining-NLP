# To install any packages permamently within on the nautilus image:
1. Pull the existing image from any of the pod yaml files you use
docker pull nakumgaurav/sbks:dev2

2. Create a container using that image and open a shell within the container
docker run -it --name="sbks_container" nakumgaurav/sbks:dev2 /bin/bash

3. Install the required packages in the container
apt-get install <package>

4. Without exiting the container, open a new terminal shell and commit the changes in a new image
docker commit -m="installed <packages>" sbks_container nakumgaurav/sbks:dev3
(this command must be issued from the host machine)
You can now exit the container

5. Push the new image to the registry
docker push nakumgaurav/sbks:dev3

6. Remove the previous image
docker rmi nakumgaurav/sbks:dev2

***THIS IS AN EXAMPLE PROMPT AND EXPECTED RESPONSE***:

### Instruction:
Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan sulfate binding site resides in a distinct sequence in immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II of the three modules of FGFR."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence:

sulfate
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II
FGFR

Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories.

Furthermore, some example relations for each class (randomly selected from the entire corpus of abstracts) are provided here, in the format, (entity_1, entity_2, class, example_sentence):

RELATED:
('dimemorfan', 'sigma-1 receptor', 'RELATED', 'Binding of dimemorfan to sigma-1 receptor and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan.')
('DF', 'sigma receptors', 'RELATED', 'This study therefore characterized the binding of DF to the sigma receptors and NMDA-linked PCP sites and examined the anticonvulsant as well as locomotor effects of DF in mice in comparison with those of DM and DR.')
('DF', 'sigma-1 receptors', 'RELATED', 'We found that DF, DM, and DR were relative high-affinity ligands at sigma-1 receptors (Ki=151, 205, 144 nM, respectively) while all of them were with low affinity at sigma-2 receptors (Ki=4-11 microM).')
('DF', 'sigma-2 receptors', 'RELATED', 'We found that DF, DM, and DR were relative high-affinity ligands at sigma-1 receptors (Ki=151, 205, 144 nM, respectively) while all of them were with low affinity at sigma-2 receptors (Ki=4-11 microM).')
('DM', 'sigma-1 receptors', 'RELATED', 'We found that DF, DM, and DR were relative high-affinity ligands at sigma-1 receptors (Ki=151, 205, 144 nM, respectively) while all of them were with low affinity at sigma-2 receptors (Ki=4-11 microM).')
NOT_RELATED:
('Dextromethorphan', '(+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan', 'NOT_RELATED', 'Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.')
('Dextromethorphan', 'DM', 'NOT_RELATED', 'Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.')
('(+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan', 'DM', 'NOT_RELATED', 'Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.')
('DM', 'N-methyl-d-aspartate', 'NOT_RELATED', 'The mechanisms of these CNS effects of DM have been suggested to be associated with the low-affinity, noncompetitive, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism of DM and/or the high-affinity DM/sigma receptors.')
('DM', 'NMDA', 'NOT_RELATED', 'The mechanisms of these CNS effects of DM have been suggested to be associated with the low-affinity, noncompetitive, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonism of DM and/or the high-affinity DM/sigma receptors.')

3. ('immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II', 'FGFR', 'NOT_RELATED').

***NOW, IT IS YOUR TURN***:

### Instruction:
Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"Cooperative binding of ATP and MgADP in the sulfonylurea receptor is modulated by glibenclamide."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence:

ATP
MgADP
sulfonylurea
sulfonylurea receptor
glibenclamide

Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories.

This code defines extension methods for the `In` method that can be used with any type, including anonymous types, to determine if an item is present in a list of items. The methods take two forms:

1. `In(this T item, params T[] items)`: This method takes a single item and a list of items as parameters, and returns `true` if the single item is present in the list of items.
2. `In(this T item, Expression<Func<T, bool>> predicate)`: This method takes a single item and a predicate expression as parameters, and returns `true` if the single item satisfies the predicate expression.
3. `In(this T item, params T[] items, Expression<Func<T, bool>> predicate)`: This method takes a single item, a list of items, and a predicate expression as parameters, and returns `true` if the single item is present in the list of items and satisfies the predicate expression.

The extension methods use linq to determine if the item is present in the list of items, and return `true` if it is present, `false` otherwise.

You can use these extension methods like this:
```
string item = "apple";
string[] items = { "apple", "banana", "orange" };

bool isIn = items.In(item); // returns true

bool isInWithPredicate = items.In(item, x => x.StartsWith("a")); // returns true

bool isInWithPredicate2 = items.In(item, "banana", x => x.StartsWith("a")); // returns false
```

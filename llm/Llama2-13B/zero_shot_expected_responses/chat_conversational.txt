***THIS IS AN EXAMPLE PROMPT AND EXPECTED RESPONSE***:

### Instruction:
Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan sulfate binding site resides in a distinct sequence in immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II of the three modules of FGFR."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence:

sulfate
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II
FGFR

Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories.

### Response:
Sure, here you go:

1. ('sulfate', 'immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II', 'RELATED')

2. ('sulfate', 'FGFR', 'RELATED')

3. ('immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II', 'FGFR', 'NOT_RELATED').

***NOW, IT IS YOUR TURN***:

### Instruction:
Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"Cooperative binding of ATP and MgADP in the sulfonylurea receptor is modulated by glibenclamide."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence:

ATP
MgADP
sulfonylurea
sulfonylurea receptor
glibenclamide

Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories.

### Response:
Sure, here you go:


#1 ('ATP', 'MgADP', 'RELATED')
#2 ('MgADP','sulfonylurea receptor', 'RELATED')
#3 ('sulfonylurea', 'glibenclamide', 'NOT_RELATED')
#4 ('sulfonylurea receptor', 'glibenclamide', 'RELATED')

Is the above output correct?

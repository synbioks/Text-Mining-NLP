***THIS IS AN EXAMPLE PROMPT AND EXPECTED RESPONSE***:

### Instruction:
Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan sulfate binding site resides in a distinct sequence in immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II of the three modules of FGFR."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence:

sulfate
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II
FGFR

Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories.

Furthermore, some example relations for each class (randomly selected from the entire corpus of abstracts) are provided here, in the format, (entity_1, entity_2, class, example_sentence):

RELATED:
('dimemorfan', 'sigma-1 receptor', 'RELATED', 'Binding of dimemorfan to sigma-1 receptor and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan.')
('DF', 'sigma receptors', 'RELATED', 'This study therefore characterized the binding of DF to the sigma receptors and NMDA-linked PCP sites and examined the anticonvulsant as well as locomotor effects of DF in mice in comparison with those of DM and DR.')
NOT_RELATED:
('Dextromethorphan', '(+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan', 'NOT_RELATED', 'Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.')
('Dextromethorphan', 'DM', 'NOT_RELATED', 'Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.')


Please use these examples as calibration to help you with this task.

### Response:
Sure, here you go:

1. ('sulfate', 'immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II', 'RELATED')

2. ('sulfate', 'FGFR', 'RELATED')

3. ('immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II', 'FGFR', 'NOT_RELATED').

***NOW, IT IS YOUR TURN***:

### Instruction:
Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"Cooperative binding of ATP and MgADP in the sulfonylurea receptor is modulated by glibenclamide."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence:

ATP
MgADP
sulfonylurea
sulfonylurea receptor
glibenclamide

Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories.

Furthermore, some example relations for each class (randomly selected from the entire corpus of abstracts) are provided here, in the format, (entity_1, entity_2, class, example_sentence):

RELATED:
('dimemorfan', 'sigma-1 receptor', 'RELATED', 'Binding of dimemorfan to sigma-1 receptor and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan.')
('DF', 'sigma receptors', 'RELATED', 'This study therefore characterized the binding of DF to the sigma receptors and NMDA-linked PCP sites and examined the anticonvulsant as well as locomotor effects of DF in mice in comparison with those of DM and DR.')
NOT_RELATED:
('Dextromethorphan', '(+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan', 'NOT_RELATED', 'Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.')
('Dextromethorphan', 'DM', 'NOT_RELATED', 'Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.')


Please use these examples as calibration to help you with this task.

### Response:
Sure, here you go:



1. ('ATP','sulfonylurea receptor', 'RELATED')
2. ('MgADP','sulfonylurea receptor', 'RELATED')
3. ('sulfonylurea', 'glibenclamide', 'NOT_RELATED')

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to simulate more instances.

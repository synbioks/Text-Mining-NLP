Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"Binding of dimemorfan to sigma-1 receptor and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence -- their identifier ('id'), whether it is a chemical or gene ('type'), line numbers in which they would be found in the full abstract ('start' and 'end'), and their name ('text'). Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories:

[{'end': 21, 'id': 'T50', 'start': 11, 'text': 'dimemorfan', 'type': 'CHEMICAL'}, {'end': 41, 'id': 'T56', 'start': 25, 'text': 'sigma-1 receptor', 'type': 'GENE-Y'}, {'end': 126, 'id': 'T49', 'start': 110, 'text': 'dextromethorphan', 'type': 'CHEMICAL'}, {'end': 142, 'id': 'T51', 'start': 131, 'text': 'dextrorphan', 'type': 'CHEMICAL'}]

Furthermore, some example relations for each class (randomly selected from the entire corpus of abstracts) are provided here, in the form, (entity_1, entity_2, CPR_class, sentence in which they are found):

RELATED:
('dimemorfan', 'sigma-1 receptor', 'RELATED', 'Binding of dimemorfan to sigma-1 receptor and its anticonvulsant and locomotor effects in mice, compared with dextromethorphan and dextrorphan.')
('DF', 'sigma receptors', 'RELATED', 'This study therefore characterized the binding of DF to the sigma receptors and NMDA-linked PCP sites and examined the anticonvulsant as well as locomotor effects of DF in mice in comparison with those of DM and DR.')
NOT_RELATED:
('Dextromethorphan', '(+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan', 'NOT_RELATED', 'Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.')
('Dextromethorphan', 'DM', 'NOT_RELATED', 'Dextromethorphan ((+)-3-methoxy-N-methylmorphinan, DM) has been shown to have both anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects.')


Please use these examples as calibration to help you with this task.

Question: Why is the Android Studio emulator running too fast?

The problem that I'm having is that the Android Studio emulator keeps starting the program at a very fast rate, I've tried to use `startApp()` as well as `runOnUiThread()` but the program keeps starting up too quickly.

Comment: What is the purpose of the emulator?  Are you trying to run a test app that simulates a user?  Or are you trying to run an app that has been installed on your Android device?

Comment: What are you trying to achieve?  What are you trying to do?  How do you expect it to happen?

Answer: You should use `startActivity` instead of `startApp`.
`startActivity` will start the application and not the whole application like startApp does.

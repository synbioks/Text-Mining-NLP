### Instruction:
Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan sulfate binding site resides in a distinct sequence in immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II of the three modules of FGFR."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence:

sulfate
immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II
FGFR

Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories.

### Response:
Sure, here you go:

1. ('sulfate', 'immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II', 'RELATED')

2. ('sulfate', 'FGFR', 'RELATED')

3. ('immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module II', 'FGFR', 'NOT_RELATED').

### Instruction:
Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"The expression of the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy controls."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence:

SHP-1
protein tyrosine phosphatase
rheumatoid arthritis
peripheral blood mononuclear cells

Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories.

### Response:
Sure, here you go:

1. ('SHP-1', 'protein tyrosine phosphatase', 'RELATED')

2. ('rheumatoid arthritis', 'peripheral blood mononuclear cells', 'RELATED')

3. ('protein tyrosine phosphatase', 'SHP-1', 'RELATED').

### Instruction:
Pretend to be an expert on relation extraction, particularly for biomedical text. The following is a sentence from a biomedical abstract:

"The gene encoding the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is located on chromosome 15 in humans."

I need you to categorize each pairwise chemical name (pair of entities) in the sentence as being 'RELATED' or 'NOT_RELATED' in the format (entity_1, entity_2, class).

To help you with this task, the following is a list of identified chemicals/genes (entities) from the sentence:

acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
chromosome 15

Use these chemicals/genes to form your relations and their categories.

### Response:
Sure, here you go:

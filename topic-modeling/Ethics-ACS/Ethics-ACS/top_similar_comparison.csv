0,CRISPR-Cas9: a promising tool for gene editing on induced pluripotent stem cells.,"Recent advances in genome editing with programmable nucleases have opened up new avenues for multiple applications, from basic research to clinical therapy. The ease of use of the technology-and particularly clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-will allow us to improve our understanding of genomic variation in disease processes via cellular and animal models. Here, we highlight the progress made in correcting gene mutations in monogenic hereditary disorders and discuss various CRISPR-associated applications, such as cancer research, synthetic biology, and gene therapy using induced pluripotent stem cells. The challenges, ethical issues, and future prospects of CRISPR-based systems for human research are also discussed.",Riboswitch-Based Reversible Dual Color Sensor,"Riboswitches are RNA-based “sensors” that utilize chemically induced structural changes in the 5′-untranslated region of mRNA to regulate expression of downstream genes.Coupling a specific riboswitch with a reporter gene system translates chemical detection by the cell into a quantifiable reporter protein signal.For the majority of reporter gene systems, the readout signal is only expressed in the presence of the target analyte.This makes it difficult to determine the viability and localization of the uninduced biosensor when it is used for “real-word” applications.To address this problem, we developed a dual-color reporter comprising elements of the E. coli fimbriae phase variation system: recombinase FimE controlled by a synthetic riboswitch and an invertible DNA segment (fimS) containing a constitutively active promoter placed between two fluorescent protein genes.Without an analyte, the fluorescent reporter constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein (GFPa1).Addition of the analyte initiated translation of fimE causing unidirectional inversion of the fimS segment and constitutive expression of red fluorescent protein (mKate2).Thus, the sensor is always fluorescent, but its color is determined by detection of a specific analyte.We demonstrate that the recombinase-based dual-color reporter can be successfully applied to monitor the activation of a theophylline synthetic riboswitch that was used as our model system.To show the feasibility of the FimE recombinase-based system to serve as a reporter for monitoring activation of multiple synthetic riboswitches and, therefore, expand the applicability of the system, we tested a number of previously developed synthetic riboswitches responsive to different analytes.We show that the dual-color reporter system can be successfully used to monitor activation of M6 and M6″ riboswitches responsive to ammeline and pyrimido­[4,5-d ]­pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, respectively, and a 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene-responsive riboswitch developed in this study.We also demonstrate that the system can be reversed by HbiF recombinase-mediated fimS inversion to the initial state of the fluorescent reporter, creating a resettable and reusable cell-based sensor."
1,How Synthetic Biology and Metabolic Engineering Can Boost the Generation of Artificial Blood Using Microbial Production Hosts,"Hemoglobin is an essential protein to the human body as it transports oxygen to organs and tissues through the bloodstream (Looker et al.,). In recent years, there has been an increasing concern regarding the global supply of this vital protein, as blood availability cannot currently meet the high demands in many developing countries. There are, in addition, several risks associated with conventional blood transfusions such as the presence of blood-borne viruses like HIV and Hepatitis. These risks along with some limitations are presented in Figure 1 (Kim and Greenburg,; Martínez et al.,). As an alternative, producing hemoglobin recombinantly will eliminate the obstacles, since hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers are pathogen-free, have a longer shelf-life, are universally compatible and the supply can be adjusted to meet the demands (Chakane,). A stable, safe, and most importantly affordable production, will lead to high availability of blood to the world population, and hence reduce global inequality, which is a focus point of the World Health Organization for the millennium (WHO,). Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have created a unique opportunity to construct promising candidates for hemoglobin production (Liu et al.,; Martínez et al.,). This review sets out to describe the recent advances in recombinant hemoglobin production, the societal and the economic impact along with the challenges that researchers will face in the coming years, such as low productivity, degradation, and difficulties in scale-up. The challenges are diverse and complex but with the powerful tools provided by synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, they are no longer insurmountable. An efficient production of cell-free recombinant hemoglobin poses tremendous challenges while having even greater potential, therefore some possible future directions are suggested in this review.
",Correlating in Vitro and in Vivo Activities of Light-Inducible Dimers: A Cellular Optogenetics Guide,"Light-inducible dimers are powerful tools for cellular optogenetics, as they can be used to control the localization and activity of proteins with high spatial and temporal resolution.Despite the generality of the approach, application of light-inducible dimers is not always straightforward, as it is frequently necessary to test alternative dimer systems and fusion strategies before the desired biological activity is achieved.This process is further hindered by an incomplete understanding of the biophysical/biochemical mechanisms by which available dimers behave and how this correlates to in vivo function.To better inform the engineering process, we examined the biophysical and biochemical properties of three blue-light-inducible dimer variants (cryptochrome2 (CRY2)/CIB1, iLID/SspB, and LOVpep/ePDZb) and correlated these characteristics to in vivo colocalization and functional assays.We find that the switches vary dramatically in their dark and lit state binding affinities and that these affinities correlate with activity changes in a variety of in vivo assays, including transcription control, intracellular localization studies, and control of GTPase signaling.Additionally, for CRY2, we observe that light-induced changes in homo-oligomerization can have significant effects on activity that are sensitive to alternative fusion strategies."
2,"Discoveries: an innovative platform for publishing cutting-edge research discoveries in medicine, biology and chemistry","Discoveries is a new peer-reviewed, open access, online multidisciplinary and integrative journal publishing high impact reviews, experimental articles, perspective articles, and editorials from all areas related to medicine, biology, and chemistry, including but not limited to: Molecular and Cellular Biology, Biochemistry, Biophysics, Genomics, Proteomics, Biotechnology, Synthetic Biology, Bioengineering, Systems Biology, Bioinformatics, Translational Medicine, Medicine/ Clinical findings, Cognitive Science, Epidemiology, Global Medicine, Family Medicine, Organic/ Inorganic/ Physical Chemistry and Ethics in Science. Discoveries brings to the research community an outstanding editorial board that aims to address several of the innovations proposed above: there is no need to format the manuscript before submission, we have a rapid and efficient submission process, there is no need for a Cover Letter and we support the need for rules for validation of critical reagents, such as antibodies. Discoveries will aim to support high quality research on human subjects materials to provide relevance for non-human studies along with mechanistic insights into human biology and chemistry. We also aim to avoid requesting unnecessary experiments during the review process, without affecting the quality and conclusions of published manuscripts. In addition, we recognize the need of adopting the recommendations made by NCCD and other similar scientific guiding entities.
",Engineering a Glucosamine-6-phosphate Responsive glmS Ribozyme Switch Enables Dynamic Control of Metabolic Flux in Bacillus subtilis for Overproduction of N ‑Acetylglucosamine,"Bacillus subtilis is a typical industrial microorganism and is widely used in industrial biotechnology, particularly for nutraceutical production.There are many studies on the static metabolic engineering of B. subtilis, whereas there are few reports on dynamic metabolic engineering due to the lack of appropriate elements.Here, we established a dynamic reprogramming strategy for reconstructing metabolic networks in B. subtilis, using a typical nutraceutical, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), as a model product and the glmS (encoding glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase) ribozyme as an engineering element.First, a trp terminator was introduced to effectively release the glmS ribozyme feedback inhibition.Further, we engineered the native glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) responsive glmS ribozyme switch to dynamically control the metabolic flux in B. subtilis for overproduction of GlcNAc.With GlcN6P as a ligand, the native sensor glmS ribozyme is integrated at the 5′-of phosphoglucosamine mutase and 6-phosphofructokinase genes to decrease the flux dynamically toward the peptidoglycan synthesis and glycolysis pathway, respectively.The glmS ribozyme mutant M5 (glmS ribozyme cleavage site AG → GG) with decreased ribozyme activity is integrated at the 5′-of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase gene to increase the flux dynamically toward the GlcNAc synthesis pathway.This strategy increased the GlcNAc titer from 9.24 to 18.45 g/L, and the specific GlcNAc productivity from 0.53 to 1.21 g GlcNAc/g cell.Since GlcN6P is involved in the biosynthesis of various products, here the developed strategy for multiple target dynamic engineering of metabolic pathways can be generally used in B. subtilis and other industrial microbes for chemical production."
3,Let’s (not) talk about synthetic biology: Framing an emerging technology in public and stakeholder dialogues,"Synthetic biology is an emerging technoscience, which, so far, lacks a broader public debate. To foster early societal dialogue, a range of public engagement events have been initiated over the past decade. This article discusses the configurations of the emerging debate on synthetic biology in the context of the EU FP7 project SYNENERGENE. Drawing on notions of frames and framing in media studies and policy analysis, we ask which distinct frames are invoked and become dominant in current discussions about synthetic biology. Our analysis indicates significant reconfigurations in the framing of synthetic biology compared with previous biotechnology debates. Frames that traditionally served to problematize biotechnology, that is, ethics, risks, and economics, become less dominant. Instead, the potential to contribute to social progress is placed in the foreground. Moreover, discussions on ethics, risks, and governance frequently occur on an abstract level, invoking generic statements that could be made for any new technology.
",Tailoring Escherichia coli for the l ‑Rhamnose P BAD Promoter-Based Production of Membrane and Secretory Proteins,"Membrane and secretory protein production in Escherichia coli requires precisely controlled production rates to avoid the deleterious saturation of their biogenesis pathways.On the basis of this requirement, the E. coli l-rhamnose P BAD promoter (P rhaBAD) is often used for membrane and secretory protein production since P rhaBAD is thought to regulate protein production rates in an l-rhamnose concentration-dependent manner.By monitoring protein production in real-time in E. coli wild-type and an l-rhamnose catabolism deficient mutant, we demonstrate that the l-rhamnose concentration-dependent tunability of P rhaBAD-mediated protein production is actually due to l-rhamnose consumption rather than regulating production rates.Using this information, a RhaT-mediated l-rhamnose transport and l-rhamnose catabolism deficient double mutant was constructed.We show that this mutant enables the regulation of P rhaBAD-based protein production rates in an l-rhamnose concentration-dependent manner and that this is critical to optimize membrane and secretory protein production yields.The high precision of protein production rates provided by the P rhaBAD promoter in an l-rhamnose transport and catabolism deficient background could also benefit other applications in synthetic biology."
4,"BioBits Health: Classroom Activities Exploring Engineering, Biology, and Human Health with Fluorescent Readouts.","Recent advances in synthetic biology have resulted in biological technologies with the potential to reshape the way we understand and treat human disease. Educating students about the biology and ethics underpinning these technologies is critical to empower them to make informed future policy decisions regarding their use and to inspire the next generation of synthetic biologists. However, hands-on, educational activities that convey emerging synthetic biology topics can be difficult to implement due to the expensive equipment and expertise required to grow living cells. We present BioBits Health, an educational kit containing lab activities and supporting curricula for teaching antibiotic resistance mechanisms and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in high school classrooms. This kit links complex biological concepts to visual, fluorescent readouts in user-friendly freeze-dried cell-free reactions. BioBits Health represents a set of educational resources that promises to encourage teaching of cutting-edge, health-related synthetic biology topics in classrooms and other nonlaboratory settings.",Engineering Adenylate Cyclase Activated by Near-Infrared Window Light for Mammalian Optogenetic Applications,"Light in the near-infrared optical window (NIRW) penetrates deep through mammalian tissues, including the skull and brain tissue.Here we engineered an adenylate cyclase (AC) activated by NIRW light (NIRW-AC) and suitable for mammalian applications.To accomplish this goal, we constructed fusions of several bacterio­phytochrome photosensory and bacterial AC modules using guidelines for designing chimeric homodimeric bacterio­phytochromes.One engineered NIRW-AC, designated IlaM5, has significantly higher activity at 37 °C, is better expressed in mammalian cells, and can mediate cAMP-dependent photoactivation of gene expression in mammalian cells, in favorable contrast to the NIRW-ACs engineered earlier.The ilaM5 gene expressed from an AAV vector was delivered into the ventral basal thalamus region of the mouse brain, resulting in the light-controlled suppression of the cAMP-dependent wave pattern of the sleeping brain known as spindle oscillations.Reversible spindle oscillation suppression was observed in sleeping mice exposed to light from an external light source.This study confirms the robustness of principles of homodimeric bacterio­phytochrome engineering, describes a NIRW-AC suitable for mammalian optogenetic applications, and demonstrates the feasibility of controlling brain activity via NIRW-ACs using transcranial irradiation."
5,The place of God in synthetic biology: how will the Catholic Church respond?,"Some religious believers may see synthetic biology as usurping God's creative role. The Catholic Church has yet to issue a formal teaching on the field (though it has issued some informal statements in response to Craig Venter's development of a 'synthetic' cell). In this paper I examine the likely reaction of the Catholic Magisterium to synthetic biology in its entirety. I begin by examining the Church's teaching role, from its own viewpoint, to set the necessary backround and context for the discussion that follows. I then describe the Church's attitude to science, and particularly to biotechnology. From this I derive a likely Catholic theology of synthetic biology. The Church's teachings on scientific and biotech research show that it is likely to have a generally positive disposition to synbio, if it and its products can be acceptably safe. Proper evaluation of, and protection against, risk will be a significant factor in determining the morality of the research. If the risks can be minimized through regulation or other means, then the Church is likely to be supportive. The Church will also critique the social and legal environment in which the research is done, evaluating issues such as the patenting of scientific discoveries and of life.",Engineering Hybrid Chemotaxis Receptors in Bacteria,"Most bacteria use transmembrane sensors to detect a wide range of environmental stimuli.A large class of such sensors are the chemotaxis receptors used by motile bacteria to follow environmental chemical gradients.In Escherichia coli, chemotaxis receptors are known to mediate highly sensitive responses to ligands, making them potentially useful for biosensory applications.However, with only four ligand-binding chemotaxis receptors, the natural ligand spectrum of E. coli is limited.The design of novel chemoreceptors to extend the sensing capabilities of E. coli is therefore a critical aspect of chemotaxis-based biosensor development.One path for novel sensor design is to harvest the large natural diversity of chemosensory functions found in bacteria by creating hybrids that have the signaling domain from E. coli chemotaxis receptors and sensory domains from other species.In this work, we demonstrate that the E. coli receptor Tar can be successfully combined with most typical sensory domains found in chemotaxis receptors and in evolutionary-related two-component histidine kinases.We show that such functional hybrids can be generated using several different fusion points.Our work further illustrates how hybrid receptors could be used to quantitatively characterize ligand specificity of chemotaxis receptors and histidine kinases using standardized assays in E. coli."
6,"Disease, dysfunction, and synthetic biology.","Theorists analyzing the concept of disease on the basis of the notion of dysfunction consider disease to be dysfunction requiring. More specifically, dysfunction-requiring theories of disease claim that for an individual to be diseased certain biological facts about it must be the case. Disease is not wholly a matter of evaluative attitudes. In this paper, I consider the dysfunction-requiring component of Wakefield's hybrid account of disease in light of the artifactual organisms envisioned by current research in synthetic biology. In particular, I argue that the possibility of artifactual organisms and the case of oncomice and other bred or genetically modified strains of organism constitute a significant objection to Wakefield's etiological account of the dysfunction requirement. I then develop a new alternative understanding of the dysfunction requirement that builds on the organizational theory of function. I conclude that my suggestion is superior to Wakefield's theory because it (a) can accommodate both artifactual and naturally evolved organisms, (b) avoids the possibility of there being a conflict between what an organismic part is supposed to do and the health of the organism, and (c) provides a nonarbitrary and practical way of determining whether dysfunction occurs.Medicine and Philosophy Inc.

7,Engineering life through Synthetic Biology.,"Synthetic Biology is a field involving synthesis of novel biological systems which are not generally found in nature. It has brought a new paradigm in science as it has enabled scientists to create life from the scratch, hence helping better understand the principles of biology. The viability of living organisms that use unnatural molecules is also being explored. Unconventional projects such as DNA playing tic-tac-toe, bacterial photographic film, etc. are taking biology to its extremes. The field holds a promise for mass production of cheap drugs and programming bacteria to seek-and-destroy tumors in the body. However, the complexity of biological systems make the field a challenging one. In addition to this, there are other major technical and ethical challenges which need to be addressed before the field realizes its true potential.",Engineering Adenylate Cyclase Activated by Near-Infrared Window Light for Mammalian Optogenetic Applications,"Light in the near-infrared optical window (NIRW) penetrates deep through mammalian tissues, including the skull and brain tissue.Here we engineered an adenylate cyclase (AC) activated by NIRW light (NIRW-AC) and suitable for mammalian applications.To accomplish this goal, we constructed fusions of several bacterio­phytochrome photosensory and bacterial AC modules using guidelines for designing chimeric homodimeric bacterio­phytochromes.One engineered NIRW-AC, designated IlaM5, has significantly higher activity at 37 °C, is better expressed in mammalian cells, and can mediate cAMP-dependent photoactivation of gene expression in mammalian cells, in favorable contrast to the NIRW-ACs engineered earlier.The ilaM5 gene expressed from an AAV vector was delivered into the ventral basal thalamus region of the mouse brain, resulting in the light-controlled suppression of the cAMP-dependent wave pattern of the sleeping brain known as spindle oscillations.Reversible spindle oscillation suppression was observed in sleeping mice exposed to light from an external light source.This study confirms the robustness of principles of homodimeric bacterio­phytochrome engineering, describes a NIRW-AC suitable for mammalian optogenetic applications, and demonstrates the feasibility of controlling brain activity via NIRW-ACs using transcranial irradiation."
